## Running Tests

### Run All Tests (Homepage Only)
```bash
yarn test
```

### Run With UI
```bash
yarn test:ui
```

### Run Specific Test File
```bash
npx playwright test tests/home.spec.ts
```

## Enabling Certification Tests

To enable the skipped certification tests, you need to set up authentication:

### Option 1: Setup Real Cognito Test Users (Recommended for Production)
1. Create test users in your Cognito User Pool
2. Add them to appropriate groups (admin, instructor, user)
3. Create `.env.test` with credentials
4. Update auth helper to handle Cognito UI flow
5. Remove `.skip` from certification tests

See `tests/README.md` for detailed instructions.

### Option 2: Use Test Bypass (For Development)
A test bypass endpoint exists at `/api/test-auth/signin` that only works in development mode. This needs additional setup to integrate with NextAuth sessions.

## Test Coverage

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Homepage UI and content
- [x] Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [x] Gradient styling and branding
- [x] Visual regression baseline

### ‚è≥ Pending Authentication Setup
- [ ] Certification CRUD operations
- [ ] AI Models CRUD operations
- [ ] Blueprint management operations
- [ ] Admin dashboard access
- [ ] Role-based permission testing

### üìã Not Yet Created
- [ ] User dashboard tests
- [ ] Authentication flow tests
- [ ] Jest unit tests for utility functions and hooks

## Notes

- **No manual `yarn dev` needed**: Playwright automatically starts the dev server
- **Test isolation**: Each test runs in a clean browser context
- **Screenshots**: Saved to `test-results/` on failures for debugging
- **Parallel execution**: Tests run in parallel across 7 workers by default

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Homepage tests are working and will catch regressions
2. **When ready for certification tests**:
   - Create test users in Cognito
   - Configure `.env.test`
   - Enable certification tests by removing `.skip`
3. **Future**: Add tests for other features as they're developed

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Timing Out
- Check dev server is accessible at `http://localhost:3000`
- Look for errors in WebServer output
- Run with `--headed` to see browser: `npx playwright test --headed`

### Authentication Issues
- Certification tests are intentionally skipped
- Don't worry about auth errors until you're ready to set up test users
- Homepage tests work without authentication
