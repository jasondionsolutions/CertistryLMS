# CertistryLMS MVP Feature Prioritization
## Dynamic, Multi-Certification Learning Platform

**Document Purpose**: Prioritized feature roadmap for building a dynamic LMS that personalizes learning paths based on initial assessments, adapts to student performance, and supports multiple certifications.

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-21

**Target Timeline**: < 1 year to MVP launch

---

## **Core Vision Summary**

Build an **adaptive learning platform** that:
- Starts with baseline diagnostic to identify knowledge gaps
- Generates personalized curriculum (skips what students already know)
- Continuously tests and adapts based on performance
- Uses spaced repetition for retention
- Supports multiple certifications with admin-configured paths
- Integrates existing PBQ system and ACI Learning API

**First Certification**: CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)

**Key Differentiator**: Unlike Udemy/Thinkific (everyone takes every lesson), our system dynamically adapts to each student's existing knowledge.

   - Weekly demos to stakeholders

---

---

## **CONCLUSION**

This MVP focuses on the **core adaptive learning loop**:

```
Diagnostic → Personalized Path → Dynamic Content → Continuous Testing → Adaptation
```

Everything in Tier 1 supports this loop. Features in Tier 2-3 are valuable but not critical for proving the concept.

**Key Success Factors**:
1. **Diagnostic accuracy** - If we can't identify gaps correctly, personalization fails
2. **Content mapping quality** - Videos must be properly tagged to objectives
3. **AI tutor reliability** - Must give correct answers or explicitly say "I don't know"
4. **Spaced repetition execution** - Flashcards must surface at right times
5. **User experience** - Must be intuitive (students won't read manuals)

**Timeline**: 12 months is aggressive but achievable if we:
- Reuse existing systems (PBQ builder, quiz creator)
- Focus relentlessly on Tier 1 only
- Use proven tech stack (avoid bleeding edge)
- Iterate based on beta feedback

**Next Decision Point**: After wireframes are complete and dev environment is set up, we'll have enough information to refine timeline and resource estimates.
