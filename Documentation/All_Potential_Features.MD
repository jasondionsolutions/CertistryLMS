### 2. Elimination Skills Laboratory
Dedicated practice mode focused purely on systematically removing wrong answers using the 30-second rule, red flag detection (extreme language, contradictions), and smart two-option decision-making.

### 3. Pattern Recognition Academy
Automatic classification of all practice questions into the 7 universal types (scenario, recall, best-practice, exception, calculation, sequence, application) with type-specific strategy coaching.

### 4. Question Autopsy System
Automated categorization of every wrong answer into knowledge gap, misreading error, or logic error with personalized remediation paths for each category.
