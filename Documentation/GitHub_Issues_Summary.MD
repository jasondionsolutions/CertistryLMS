## Development Workflow

### Recommended Approach

1. **Start with Phase 0** - Complete all foundation issues (#1-#8) before moving forward
2. **Mark issues as you work** - Assign yourself, add comments, link PRs
3. **Check off summary issues** - Update phase summaries as sub-issues close
4. **Follow dependencies** - Issues list dependencies; don't skip ahead
5. **Track in project board** - Consider creating a GitHub Project for kanban view

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Filter issues by phase
gh issue list --label "Phase 0"

# View specific issue
gh issue view 1

# Start working on issue
gh issue develop 1 --checkout

# Close issue when complete
gh issue close 1 --comment "Implemented Next.js project setup"
```

## Development Timeline Estimate

Based on 4-hour average per issue:

- **Phase 0**: 32 hours (8 issues × 4h)
- **Phases 1-4 (Admin)**: ~80 hours
- **Phases 5-12 (Student Core)**: ~140 hours
- **Phases 13-15 (Strategic Tools)**: ~48 hours
- **Phases 16-21 (Supporting)**: ~52 hours

**Total**: ~352 hours (~9 weeks at 40 hours/week, ~12 months at 8 hours/week)

**Note**: This assumes single developer. With team of 2-3, timeline reduces significantly.

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **All issues created** - Complete!
2. **Review Phase 0 issues** - Understand foundation requirements
3. **Set up development environment** - Follow Phase 0 issues
4. **Start implementation** - Begin with #1 (Initialize Next.js Project)
5. **Track progress** - Update summary issues as phases complete
6. **Iterate based on learning** - Adjust estimates as you work

---

## Scripts Created

Three helper scripts were created to generate all issues:

1. `create_github_issues.sh` - Phases 1-2
2. `create_remaining_issues.sh` - Phases 3-5
3. `create_final_phases.sh` - Phases 6-21

These can be referenced if additional issues need to be created in the same format.

---

## Success!

✅ **93 GitHub issues created**
✅ **22 phases defined (0-21)**
✅ **5 milestones configured**
✅ **Labels created for filtering**
✅ **All issues assigned to @jasondionsolutions**

The complete development roadmap is now in GitHub and ready for implementation!
